    """ Calculate the trans A/B ratio for each bead in the structure.
    
    Trans A/B ratio is defined as the ratio of the number of inter-chromosomal A beads within a distance threshold
    divided by the number of inter-chromosomal B beads within the same distance threshold:
        transAB[i] = N_trans_A[i] / N_trans_B[i],
        where N_trans_A[i] is the number of inter-chromosomal A beads within a distance threshold of bead i,
        and N_trans_B[i] is the number of inter-chromosomal B beads within the same distance threshold of bead i.

    Args:
        struct_id (int): The index of the structure in the HSS file.
        hss (alabtools.analysis.HssFile)
        params (dict): A dictionary containing the parameters for the analysis.

    Returns:
        (np.ndarray): The inter-chromosomal contact probability of each bead in the structure.
