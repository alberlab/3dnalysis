    """ Compute the lamin TSA-seq signal for a given structure.
    
    The lamina is estimated from the most external beads of the structure.
    The TSA-seq signal is computed as the sum of the exponential of the distances to the lamina:
        TSA[i] = sum_j exp(-alpha * dist(i, j))

    Args:
        struct_id (int): The index of the structure in the HSS file.
        hss_opt (h5py.File): The optimized HSS file, with coordinates of different structures in separate datasets.
        params (dict): A dictionary containing the parameters for the analysis.

    Returns:
        (np.ndarray): TSA-distances to the lamina for each bead in the structure.
