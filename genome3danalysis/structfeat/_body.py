    The distance is calculated as the minimum distance between each bead and each body.
    
    The TSA-distance is calculated as the sum of the exponential of the negative distance between each bead and each body:
           TSA[i] = sum_j exp(-alpha * dist[i,j])

    Args:
        struct_id (int): The index of the structure in the HSS file.
        hss_opt (h5py.File): The optimized HSS file, with coordinates of different structures in separate datasets.
        params (dict): A dictionary containing the parameters for the analysis.
        what_to_measure (str): Either 'dist' or 'tsa', to calculate the distance or the TSA-distance, respectively.

    Returns:
        (np.ndarray): distance or TSA-distance for each bead.
