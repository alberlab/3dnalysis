We checked that the radial profile avg and std matches
with the code I wrote for previous structural features computation.

We have to add the gap file in the pipeline.

Then we have to write the rest of the structural features.

We added the GAP file in the pipeline. We haven't tested it yet.

We also added the Lamina computation (we used a mathematical formula
that is different than how Asli did it). We will have to check that this method
matches the results of Asli's method.

Next time we have to write the Nuclear Body structural features,
then the TransAB, ICP and RG.
